Inventory Program: inventory.cpp – 20 pts



Write a program that uses a structure to store the following inventory data in a file:

Item Description
Product ID
Quantity on Hand
Wholesale Cost
Retail Cost
The program should have a menu that allows the user to perform the following tasks:

Add new records to the file
Search and display a record in the file (search should be based on product ID)
Change a record in the file (you can change any member except the product ID)
Quit program
The program should continue as long as the user doesn’t choose to quit.

Input Validation: The menu choices should be only 1 – 4.  The program should not accept quantities, or wholesale or retail costs, less than 0.0.
